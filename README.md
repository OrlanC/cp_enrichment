## Enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways using clusterProfiler packge in R
This repository shows how to perform enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways in non-model organisms using the 
[clusterProfiler](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html) in R. 
Please visit https://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/ for any doubt or detailed instructions
to set up parameters of your enrichment analysis or visualize your results in fancy plots.
